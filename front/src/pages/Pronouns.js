      <h1>What does 'they/them' mean?</h1>
      <p>
        In the context of blue being male and pink being female (which is itself
        a very recent gender convention), I like to describe myself as green.
        Neither end of the spectrum feels right and neither set of conventional
        pronouns feel right.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        This is me asking you to use the pronouns "they," "them," and "theirs"
        when you're talking about me.
      </blockquote>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "<strong>They</strong> are at work right now."
        </li>
        <li>
          "You can ask <strong>them</strong> if you have questions."
        </li>
        <li>
          "<strong>Their</strong> hair is naturally brown."
        </li>
        <li>
          "That idea was <strong>theirs</strong>."
        </li>
        <li>
          "They are too lazy to make <strong>themself</strong> dinner."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you mess up, it's alright; you're not the only one. Correct yourself
        and move on. If I correct you, that means you have made me feel safe
        enough to advocate for myself; believe it or not, it's a compliment.
